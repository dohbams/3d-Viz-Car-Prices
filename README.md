# Comparing Car Prices and Mileage Among Top Nigerian Car Brands

This 3D chart compares the selling prices of popular car brands in Nigeria alongside their mileage. The overall trend of the chart is that car price increases as mileage decreases. This is because newer cars tend to have lower mileage and are therefore more expensive. However, there are some exceptions to this trend. For example, luxury car brands like Mercedes-Benz and Lexus tend to have higher prices, even at higher mileage.
